When I managed the QA department at Accusoft, we held weekly book clubs called "the cooking club". We picked technical books that were in the cookbook format, went through them week by week, and each of us would pick a recipe or two to complete.

This project stores my work on the recipes in Unmesh Gundecha's book "Selenium Testing Tools Cookbook" which I implemented in Ruby (most of the examples in the book were shown in C# or Java). I did not know Ruby at all when this started, and I just wanted to add a bit more challenge. I had also heard from a couple people that Ruby is a great language for QA folks like me, and I wanted to know why. 

Here is a list of the exercises that I have completed so far. Some of these should run as is because they run against public web sites, but many of them were run against test servers I set up internally so they would require additional setup.
